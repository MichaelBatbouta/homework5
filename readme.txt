edit to given JSON - added blank tile and N has amount 6 not 5.
no extra credit was done but I didnt accomplish everything on the criteria
few things:
onces a user puts a piece down they must keep going or restart game 
i added a few inline comments where i got specific code such as random number cause i used that basically word for word.
but other stuff i edited a little i just added at the top so that the code wasnt as cluttered!

Thank you for a great summer session!

It does say a complete write up so here it is:
letter tiles are randomly selected with random number generator then taken out of an array with every number loaded as many times as they have left
drag and drop works
the specific tile it is droped on is know as show by correct score and word display
board includes 4 bonus squares!
score is calculated by the scrabble rules i looked up!
user can play until they dont want to or tile pool falls below 7 tiles
board is cleared after each round
only the tiles used are cleared and replaces
score is kept until restart
tiles will return home if not placed in a allowed spot
tiles cant be moved once placed
tiles must be placed at an approved location after the first
 start over always works!
